# Binary Rank Aggregation Classifier

A classifier that uses rank aggregation to classify objects.

It can be applied to data where ranking of features makes sense. Biological data is one of the most suitable examples, where one can rank the presence of different molecules in a sample.

The classifier is implemented using the scikit-learn API.

The repository and implementation has been structured based on the template provided at https://github.com/scikit-learn-contrib/project-template/tree/master/skltemplate
